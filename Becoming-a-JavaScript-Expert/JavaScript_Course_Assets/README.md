# Building High Performance JavaScript Web Applications - Course Examples

This repository contains a directory for each chapter in the course containing all of the examples from that chapter, which you can run on your local computer and experiment with as you work your way through the course material.

Most of the examples can be run on your local computer without requiring any special setup or configuration. Some of the examples are different however, the AJAX chapter (chapter8), for example, requires that the examples all be run over HTTP using a web server. In light of this, this repository also contains some additional software that will allow you to quickly and easily setup and run a web server on your local computer.

The software required is called Node.js and must be installed to able to use the web server.
